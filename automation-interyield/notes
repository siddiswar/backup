						Known issues/challenges
===================================================================================================================================
1. Master IY Pop and Aggressive IY Pop Test Cases needs to be run sequentially in local machine.
   As we cannot have all the browsers configured in a single machine, need to build and run the script 
   in different machines with different set of browsers and browser versions.
   Identify where to run these test cases and respective data need to provided in excel sheets 
   as data provider.
   We still do not have solution to test these functionalities in mobile platform.
2. Other test cases can be run in parallel in remote web driver using browser stack.

===================================================================================================================================
						A. Steps to build and execute the project:
===================================================================================================================================

1. Checkout the project
2. Change it to Maven project 
3. Run the goal mvn clean install

(This step may fail if you try to run the goal from eclipse as eclipse doesn't point to JDK instead it may point to JRE,
so change the path to point to JDK as Goto Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs -> Change the path location to point out to JDK1.7)
 
4. From the target directory find automation-interyield-1.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz(this can be shared to the client) and extract it
5. From the extracted path(say I extracted automation-interyield-1.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz to D - Disk Drive as automation-interyield-1.0-SNAPSHOT) run the following command from command line interpreter as 
	D:\automation-interyield-1.0-SNAPSHOT>java -cp "lib/*;conf/" org.testng.TestNG  conf\testng.xml -groups <groupname>
	
6. If you want to run the tests in local machine then change the property value of run_mode under driver.properties 
	of conf/ directory to local i.e. run_mode=local
7. If you want to run the tests in remote machine like browserstack then change the property value of run_mode under driver.properties 
	of conf/ directory to remote i.e. run_mode=remote
8. Edit the .xlsx files present under conf/templatedata/ directory to give the required input data as in section B. 		
	
=======================================================================================================================================
						B. Working with Excel Data
=======================================================================================================================================
1. The input data with different combinations lies in templatedata folder of the conf directory of the project structure as conf/templatedata/
2. you can see 2 different excel sheets as AggressivePop.xlsx meant for Aggressive Pop functionality, MasterPop.xlsx meant for Master Pop functionality 
   and InputData.xlsx for rest of the functionalities  
   
	a. AggressivePop.xlsx contains 2 sheets to run test functionality for Aggressive Pop
		1. sheet with name 'HTMLElements' that contains different web elements of javascript which we will use to trigger an event/pop
		2. sheet with name 'AggressivePop' that contains different test cases with different combinations of input data
	b. MasterPop.xlsx contains 2 sheets to run test functionality for Master Pop
		1. sheet with name 'HTMLElements' that contains different web elements of javascript which we will use to trigger an event/pop
		2. sheet with name 'MasterPop' that contains different test cases with different combinations of input data
	c. InputData.xlsx contains 3 sheets to run test functionalities other than Master Pop and Aggressive Pop 
		1. sheet with name 'BrowserData' that contains browser details like BROWSER and BROWSER VERSION where tests need to be run
		2. sheet with name 'DesktopPlatform' that contains OS details like OS, OS VERSION and RUN MODE where tests need to be run. 
			Select Y against RUN MODE corresponding to a row for which you want to run the tests.  
		3. sheet with name 'MobilePlatform' that contains mobile platform details like PLATFORM, BROWSER, DEVICE and RUN MODE where tests need to be run.
		    Select Y against RUN MODE corresponding to a row for which you want to run the tests.		   

=======================================================================================================================================
						C. Which test suite or test group need to be executed can be decided as below:
=======================================================================================================================================

If you want to run all IY tests i.e. IY tests of all the functionalities then select group name 'IYTests'
If you want to run all IYD tests i.e. IYD tests of all the functionalities then select group name 'IYDTests'

If you want to run all Desktop tests i.e. test all the functionalities in desktop desktop then select group name 'DesktopTests'
If you want to run all Mobile tests i.e. test all the functionalities in mobile platform then select group name 'MobileTests'

If you want to run all IY tests in Desktop i.e. test all the IY test functionalities in desktop platform then select group name 'DesktopIYTests'
If you want to run all IYD tests in Desktop i.e. test all the IYD test functionalities in desktop platform then select group name 'DesktopIYDTests'

If you want to run all IY tests in mobile i.e. test all the IY test functionalities in mobile platform then select group name 'MobileIYTests'
If you want to run all IYD tests in mobile i.e. test all the IYD test functionalities in mobile platform then select group name 'MobileIYDTests'

If you want to run all tests irrespective of IY or IYD or Desktop Platform or Mobile Platform then select group name 'AllTests'

If you want to run individual tests to include IY, IYD, Desktop Platform and Mobile Platform then select respective group name from below:

'AdCountTests'
'AggressivePopTests'
'BackCatcher1Tests'
'BackCatcher2Tests'
'MasterPopTests'
'MatureContentTests'
'OptOutTests'
'SleepTests'
'SnoozeAlarmTests'
'SnoozeTests'

If you want to run individual tests say for AdCount functionality and include IY or IYD, Desktop Platform or Mobile Platform then select respective group name from below:

'IYAdCountTests' - this test will run for AdCount functionality for Desktop and Mobile Platforms for IY only
'IYDAdCountTests' - this test will run for AdCount functionality for Desktop and Mobile Platforms for IYD only

'DesktopAdCountTests' - this test will run for AdCount functionality for IY and IYD for Desktop Platform only
'MobileAdCountTests' - this test will run for AdCount functionality for IY and IYD for Mobile Platform only

Like wise total groups are as as follows:

'AllTests'

'IYTests'
'IYDTests'

'DesktopTests'
'MobileTests'

'DesktopIYTests'
'DesktopIYDTests'

'MobileIYTests'
'MobileIYDTests'

Individual Functionality Tests that will run for both IY and IYD and desktop and mobile platforms

'AdCountTests'
'SnoozeAlarmTests'
'AggressivePopTests'
'BackCatcher1Tests'
